This window needs to know what its initial view controller is, and that gets set to its rootViewController property. This is all handled by our storyboard. In the Single View App template, the root view controller is the ViewController, but we embedded ours inside a navigation controller, then embedded that inside a tab bar controller. So, for us the root view controller is a UITabBarController.

This is done using the UIStoryboard class, as shown. You don't need to provide a bundle, because nil means "use my current app bundle."
            let vc = storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "NavController") // We create our view controller using the instantiateViewController() method, passing in the storyboard ID of the view controller we want. Earlier we set our navigation controller to have the storyboard ID of "NavController", so we pass that in.
